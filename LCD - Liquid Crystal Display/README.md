# LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)  
#### Interfacing with an LCD display can seem like a daunting task, but its actually quite simple. Here we are learning to use the I2C (i^2C) protocal to interface with the display.  

Learning ALL of the ins and outs of this specific LCD display is not quite what I am after. I want to better understand using new librarys for arduino. I plan on learning many librarys for many things, so I find it important to be capable of picking up a new library whenever necessary. Throughout this entire project I wll use many librarys, but I will not focus on learning the low level functionality of the hardware, rather, fucusing on the functionality built into the library using examples and documentation.
