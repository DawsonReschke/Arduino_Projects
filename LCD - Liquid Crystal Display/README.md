# LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)  
#### Interfacing with an LCD display can seem like a daunting task, but its actually quite simple. Here we are learning to use the I2C (i^2C) protocal to interface with the display.  

Learning ALL of the ins and outs of this specific LCD display is not quite what I am after. I want to better understand using new librarys for arduino. I plan on learning many librarys for many things, so I find it important to be capable of picking up a new library whenever necessary.

### Projects in the section:  
-Click Counter : Counts the amount of times the user presses a button, then displays that count on the LCD  
-Potentiometer Reader : Uses 'analogRead' to display a voltage from a potentiometer
