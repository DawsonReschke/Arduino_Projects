This arduino program uses some of the concepts that I've learned from the LED section in order to achieve our goal: Create a program that counts the number of button presses and displays it on a 20x4 LCD display.  

# Concepts used:
- Interrupts (State Management) // using interrupts to control the state of the program
- Functions
- Volatile & Const Vars 

# Concepts learned:
- External Library (LiquidCrystal_I2C.h)
